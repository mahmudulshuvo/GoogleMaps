# GoogleMaps
Used skobbler maps sdk to demonstrate a graphical turn by turn navigation system. User only have to give the information about the source and the destinatination by simply giving its cordinate or name. When the "start simulation" button will be tapped it'll automatically start navigation. The audio service is also great. It tells exactly which way to go and how far to go.
